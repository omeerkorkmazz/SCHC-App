# SCHC-App
SCHC is a desktop application that provides secure communication between a client and a server by using hash chains in its workflow. Basically, backward-forward security, confidentiality, message integrity and authentication are provided by hash chains and encrpytion algorithms such as AES during the communication. The keys for communication may be regenerated if needed. In addition, hash chains to generate a key for encrpytion/decrpytion protocols can be flushed. This application has been developed for a Network Security course project in Sabanci University.
